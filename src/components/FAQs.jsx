            A hackathon is best described as an ‚Äúinvention marathon‚Äù.
            Anyone who has an interest in technology attends a hackathon to learn, build & share their creations over the course of a weekend in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.
            You don‚Äôt have to be a programmer and you certainly don‚Äôt have to be majoring in Computer Science.
